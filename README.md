## üöÄ Project Overview  
Falls are a leading cause of injury among the elderly and individuals with mobility impairments. Existing fall detection methods (vision-based, deep learning, or manual systems) suffer from issues like **privacy concerns, high computational costs, and delayed response times**.  

**DeepFall AI** addresses these challenges by combining:  
- **Edge Computing on ESP32-S3** (low power, real-time).  
- **MPU6050 IMU + KY-039 Heart Rate Sensor** for motion + physiological monitoring.  
- **Heuristic Decision Tree Algorithm** derived from machine learning for lightweight, rule-based inference.  
- **Multi-Channel Alerts** via buzzer, NeoPixel LEDs, and **IoT-based Telegram notifications (IFTTT integration)**.  

This approach ensures **fast detection, privacy preservation, low energy consumption, and high reliability** in real-world deployments.
